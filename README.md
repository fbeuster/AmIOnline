This is just a basic application, that shows a text on the screen,
indicating wether a decive is connected to the internet or not.

I just thought it's nice to have when you working on your home
network. The wifi might be running, but maybe without an internet
connection. So, yeah :)

Made in [AndroidStudio 1.5](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).
